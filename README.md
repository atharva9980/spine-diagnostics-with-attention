Classified  xray images of spine into 3 classes using advanced state of art techniques and attention mechanism

**Project**: Multi-Class Spine X-ray Classification Using Attention-Augmented Deep Neural Networks

**Objective**: Engineered a high-precision image classification framework to differentiate between Normal, Scoliosis, and Spondylolisthesis categories in spinal X-ray datasets.


**Data Preprocessing**: Processed a dataset of 338 X-ray images with advanced preprocessing pipelines, implementing oversampling strategies for class balance, normalization, and augmentation to optimize model robustness and generalization.


**Architectural Framework**: Employed transfer learning on high-performance architectures—Xception, InceptionV3, and DenseNet—while developing a custom convolutional backbone (GBCNet) to enhance model flexibility and feature representation depth.


**Attention Layer Integration**: Enhanced the deep network stack with attention modules to dynamically prioritize diagnostically significant regions, thus refining spatial feature mapping and improving model interpretability and discriminative accuracy.


**Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, pretrained CNNs, custom architecture integration, spatial attention mechanisms, and data augmentation for image classification tasks.
